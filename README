# Docker Deep Dive

## Overview

This repository documents my journey of learning Docker in depth—from core concepts and internals to practical, production-ready usage. The goal is to understand **how Docker works**, **why it works**, and **how to apply it effectively** when building, deploying, and scaling large applications, even across teams or environments that use different technology stacks.

## Why This Repository

Modern applications often involve multiple services, languages, and deployment environments. Docker provides a consistent way to package and run applications, but using it well requires more than basic commands. This repository focuses on:

* Deep understanding of Docker fundamentals
* Practical examples for real-world development
* Best practices for scalable and maintainable systems

## What You Will Find Here

* Docker fundamentals (images, containers, volumes, networks)
* How Docker works internally (layers, union file systems, container runtime basics)
* Writing efficient and secure `Dockerfile`s
* Docker Compose for multi-service applications
* Environment configuration for development vs production
* Common pitfalls and performance considerations
* Examples applicable to backend systems (APIs, databases, services)

## Learning Goals

* Understand Docker architecture and core components
* Build minimal, optimized Docker images
* Run and manage multi-container applications
* Use Docker confidently in large-scale application development
* Collaborate across teams with different technology stacks

## Structure (Planned)

```

## Who This Is For

* Developers learning Docker from scratch
* Backend engineers working on large applications
* Teams needing consistent environments across different tech stacks

## Status

This repository is actively evolving as my Docker knowledge deepens.
